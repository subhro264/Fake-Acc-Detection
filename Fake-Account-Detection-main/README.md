Fake Account Detection with Blockchain Integration

This project implements a Fake Account Detection System that combines Machine Learning for classification and Blockchain (Solidity Smart Contracts) for secure and transparent record-keeping.

It includes a backend server, ML model deployment setup, and blockchain smart contracts for decentralized trust management.
